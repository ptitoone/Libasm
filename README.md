### Assembly language
This project aims to get a basic understanding of the assembly language in Intel syntax. A few functions had to be written and archived in a library format. Then a testing program had to be written in C and compiled with the library.

## Usage
**Note:** This project runs on Linux.

Build the program using `make all`. To include the bonus functions, use `make bonus`. Run the `libsam.out` or `libasm_bonus.out` to execute the tester compiled with the assembly library.

## Skills Gained
Basics of Intel syntax, stack and register manipulation, data sizes, external C function calls and unit testing.
